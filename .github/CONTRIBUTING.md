Bugs
----

A bug is a *demonstrable problem* that is caused by the code in the repository.

Please read the following guidelines before you 
[report an issue](https://github.com/MTecknology/script-helpers/issues).

1.  **Use the GitHub issue search** -- check if the issue has already been reported.
    If it has been, please comment on the existing issue.

2.  **Check if the issue has been fixed** -- Various point-release branches may
    already contain a fix. Please try to reproduce the bug against the latest git
    ``HEAD`` or the latest release.

3.  **Isolate the demonstrable problem** -- make sure that the code in the project's
    repository is *definitely* responsible for the issue.

4.  **Include a reproducible example** -- Provide the steps which led you to the
    problem.

Please try to be as detailed as possible in your report, too. What is your
environment? What steps will reproduce the issue? What Operating System? What
would you expect to be the outcome? All these details will help people to
assess and fix any potential bugs.

Valid bugs will be categorized for the next release.
