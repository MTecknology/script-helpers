One of the biggest headaches I run into at any company in technichal debt. No
matter how many times I recommend a central set of well-tested reusable
functions available on every system for every script to improve consistency,
speed, readability, etc.

So... here it is. I don't know if anyone will ever use it, but it's time for
such a "library" to finally exist.
