One of the biggest headaches I run into at any company in technichal debt. No
matter how many times I recommend a central set of well-tested reusable
functions available on every system for every script to improve consistency,
speed, readability, etc., it's always considered "too much work" or some other
terrible excuse.

So... here it is. I don't know if anyone will ever use it, but it's time for
such a "library" to finally exist.
