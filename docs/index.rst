Script Helpers
==============

Script Helpers are simple little functions to help write and maintain high-quality
scripts. These helpers conform to language specifications and target the lowest
common denominator.

Benefits
--------

- Prevent technical debt.
- Stop re-inventing the wheel.
- Extensive testing.
- Close care to quality.
- Simple and easy-to-use.

Origin
------

This collection of functions (& documentation, tests, etc.) was created because
of frustrations with technical debt seen at various employers/clients. There
were often many copies of many functions tweaked for various reasons. Many
scripts were created largely from copied and pastied blobs found on sites like
StackOverflow that were never tested or understood.
